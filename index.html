        Welcome to the website of the Catholic Parish of Christ the Eternal High Priest, at Gidea Park, in the London Borough of Havering, England.

        Our parish has a very special dedication to ‘Christ the Eternal High Priest’. This is inspired by the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews, in which the writer describes Jesus
 Christ as a priest, the new priest who offers himself as the one, perfect sacrifice for the sins of the world. We know of no other parish which has this dedication.
      </p>

        The parish was founded in 1964 and was derived from the parish of St Edward in nearby Romford. We belong to the deanery of Havering. There have been four parish
priests here. Fr John Crawford Leighton was the first. Fr Francis Kerrigan oversaw the building of the church, which was opened in 1974. Fr Gerard Hughes was parish
priest for twenty-eight years. Fr Adrian Graffy has been parish priest here since 2011.
