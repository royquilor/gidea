          During the first months of 2013 there have been major improvements to the church. New windows have been installed in the roof and all the
   ground level windows and doors have been replaced. There is a new confessional which allows people to choose between kneeling to receive
   the sacrament or sitting face-to-face with the priest. There is also a disabled toilet.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
          On 3rd July 2013 the parish celebrated these developments with a special Service of Blessing and Thanksgiving. We were happy to welcome
  clergy who are friends of the parish, including Fr Francis Van Son, who helps out regularly in the parish, the local dean Fr Tom Jordan, and
  Fr Roderick Hindley from the local Anglican parish of St Alban’s.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
          We are grateful to Anne Dixon and Charlene Campbell of Green Tea Architects, who led the project, to Howard Denmark, our builders, and to
   A2Z, who designed and installed the ground floor windows and doors. Our parishioner, Mr Bob Hind, was project manager.

          Visitors to the church are struck by the Chi-Rho etching on all the ground-floor doors and windows. These are two Greek letters which are
   superimposed in this very ancient symbol for Christ: Chi, which resembles a Latin X, and Rho, which is like a Latin P. They are the first two
   letters of Christos, the Greek word meaning ‘Christ’.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
          As you approach the Church the symbol welcomes you. Once inside the Church the symbol is legible from the inside. The multiple windows
   and doors constantly remind us that Christ lies at the heart of our faith, and that our parish is uniquely dedicated to him. We are ‘Christians’,
   followers of Christ.

          The new benches, although not part of the church refurbishment but demanded of us to resolve Health and Safety issues, have now been in use
  for three months and, as far as I can tell, most parishioners seem pleased with them.   Fr. Adrian and I have been carefully watching the way in
  which you have been moving about in the church and a few initial teething problems with the Communion Procession seem to have been resolved
  by yourselves.It is always a good idea to raise the kneelers when you leave the benches as this helps to reduce the risk of others tripping on
  them.

          The next stage, stage 2 of the refurbishment plan, will address the liturgical issues concerning the Sanctuary, and redecorate the inside of the
 church. Outline plans to slightly alter the floor plan of the Sanctuary have been drawn up.   This will enable the provision of a Baptistery and
 provide space for a new altar, ambo, presidential chair and Altar Server seating. We are complying with the instructions given to us by Bishop
 Thomas and Bishop Alan in this regard. The plans need to follow the instructions and guidance covering these matters. Discussions with our
 architect have also included the decoration of the walls around and ceiling above the Sanctuary.

          My guestimate for the work is about £90,000 and you have to date donated and raised in excess of £65,000, for which we are deeply grateful. Your
donations to the Refurbishment Fund are still vitally important. The work that is to be carried out will provide a worthy place of worship for at least t
the next 30 to 50 years. We are a growing and vibrant parish and it is our duty to provide for ourselves and the next generation of Gidea Park
Parishioners.

          Here is a proposal for you to consider and tell me your thoughts.
 Many visitors and a number of Gidea Park parishioners ask why the church is only unlocked for Masses and Services as they would like to have
 the opportunity to pop in for a few moments of quiet prayer at other times.   The answer is “a need for security”.
 </p>
<p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure mt0 ">
 However, imagine the area on the
 right of the Narthex that includes the flower storage cupboard and the area that, until lately, housed the statue of Our Lady being converted into a
 small chapel with a glass wall looking into the main church.
 </p>
<p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure mt0 ">
 The inner main church doors could be locked, providing security, with the outside
 doors being unlocked and so giving access to the small chapel.   The chapel could be dual purpose furnished to enable its use as a quiet prayer
 chapel out of Mass/Service times and an area, often referred to as a “Cry Chapel” where adults could take young children during Mass/Services.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 f4-ns">

        <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure mt0">
          At the Parish meeting held in the Church Hall early last year, I presented an outline for an extension to the rear of the church to mirror the parts of
 the church that constitute the Sacristy and boiler house.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
          Fr. Adrian and I have had discussions with our architect and the Diocesan Building Officer to explore the feasibility of this and it would seem that
 there are no physical problems to prevent this construction.
 </p>
 <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
 The advantages to the church would be the provision of a Lady Chapel that would be
 open to the main church, provision of extra room for the Baptistery, if this is to be on the left hand side of the Sanctuary, an extra seating area for
 the church and a flower arranging workroom and storage facility to replace the storage area lost if the “Cry Chapel” idea is implemented
 Fr. Adrian and I would be pleased to hear your comments on these works.

The Diocese demands that any major capital expenditure by a parish must be self- funding.   If the expenditure is from reserves, then plans must
be put in place to replenish the money in a reasonable time period.   If the money is not in place then detailed plans of how the money is to be
raised must be provided.
</p>
<p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
The new benches have been paid for from Parish reserve funds as they were classed as necessary replacements as the old benches were
declared a Health and Safety risk, evidenced by two injury claims.
</p>
<p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
Our Church Refurbishment Fund currently stands at just over £65,000.   Many thanks for your generosity so far.    The rough estimates for Stage 2
are about £90,000 so we are just over two thirds of the way to what we need.
</p>
<p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
Please, please, please support our refurbishment fund-raising activities and donate as generously as possible to the Refurbishment Fund
collections.
</p>
<p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
In the 2015/16 TAX year our Gift Aid organisers enabled over £10,000 to be claimed back from the TAX man. I know that it is not possible but if
all weekly loose cash collection money were to be Gift Aided, the TAX reclaim would be trebled (£30,000) at no cost to the donors.   ( A plug for
Gift Aiding your offertory ).
</p>
<p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
As more information becomes available I will ensure that it is published and made available for all to see. I am very enthusiastic with regards to
 the proposals to carry out work on OUR Church and I would be pleased to hear your comments, suggestions and reservations.
